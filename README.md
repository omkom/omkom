# 🌟 AI Growth & Transition Director Journey

## 👋 About Me

### Background & Expertise

I’m **Erlé Alberton**.  I used to be a **Growth & Performance Marketing Director**, and with **more than 20 years of experience** driving digital transformation and business growth【821144536020509†screenshot】 I now focus on being an **AI tools and process creator**.  After **three years of intensive work with AI**, I’ve become an accomplished *AI driver*—designing systems that automate operations, optimise decisions and inspire teams【668345708788307†L10-L16】.  My leadership style blends *boldness, strategic thinking, adaptability and data‑driven decision‑making*【821144536020509†screenshot】.  In 2020 I was awarded **“Search Personality of the Year” at SMX Paris**, and I’ve been a **renowned speaker since 2008** and recognised among the **Top 10 French search marketing influencers in 2016**【821144536020509†screenshot】.  My career began as a *full‑stack developer and lead SEO* on Orange’s information portals and later expanded to managing the SEO of **Orange & Sosh’s e‑commerce sites**【598248941438395†L30-L33】.  At **OnCrawl** I launched the *Customer Success Manager division* and advised enterprise clients on data representation and analysis【598248941438395†L33-L35】.  

Between 2019 and 2024 I held multiple leadership roles at **Reezocar**: as **Acquisition & Digital Performance Manager** (2019–2021) I led cross‑functional teams and achieved a **137 % increase in SEO traffic within 100 days**【901585660147440†screenshot】; as **Performance Architect & Senior SEO Expert** (2021–2023) I redesigned the marketing stack and drove **natural traffic growth from 1.3 M to 3.4 M visits per month**【901585660147440†screenshot】; and as **Head of Marketing Technology** (2023–2024) I oversaw a team of 13, scaled the entire marketing tech stack via GTM, Google Ads, Customer.io and n8n, and reduced content creation costs by **65 % while increasing organic traffic by 9 %**【821144536020509†screenshot】.  

Beyond corporate roles, I work as an **independent consultant** (2020–2024), delivering digital strategy, technical audits and rapid execution for global brands and startups.  My engagements range from designing advanced TMS and CRM systems for a Web3/Blockchain NeoBank to guiding technical optimisations for Boulanger and leading digital transitions for Patek Philippe, Rakuten and Eskimoz【395711594880008†screenshot】.  During **2022–2023** I also served as **Chief Digital & Marketing Officer** for **Rayn/AKT.io**, a Web3 neobank, where I integrated GDPR compliance via *Didomi*, implemented **GA4** tracking for improved analytics, supervised Facebook, Google and Apple Ads, improved client onboarding by **27 %** and deployed **CMP Customer.io** and **Adjust** integrations for personalised marketing and attribution【684881490532367†screenshot】.
